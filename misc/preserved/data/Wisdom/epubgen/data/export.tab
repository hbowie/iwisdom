Design	Eric Abrahamson and David H. Freeman	A Perfect Mess: The Hidden Benefits of Disorder	3	Book	Copyright	2006	0316114758	Keep Creating throughout the Construction Process	<p> As it turns out, Gehry is concerned not with the precise angles or dimensions of a building, but with the emotional impression it instills in observers and inhabitants. The ability to convey this impression is elusive and fragile, he maintains, and can easily be lost in the neat, unambiguous precision of a two-dimensional drawing. </p> <p> To capture the building's intended emotional content, Gehry maintains, everyone working on the building should keep creating throughout the construction process. Withholding blueprints is a way of making sure that happens. Forgoing a detailed plan is disruptive it creates convolution, making a neat and well-defined process messy. </p>	Eric Abrahamson and David H.

Decisions, Civ3M	Chris Argyris and Donald Schön	Theory in Practice: Increasing Personal Effectiveness	3	Book	Copyright	1974	1555424465	Model II Decision-Making	<p> Model II encourages the individual to maximize his uniqueness. If, in doing so, he should arrive at goals that differ from those developed by others, he will have done so under conditions of openness, trust and risk-taking. The individual would therefore feel free to discuss his differences openly with the group. Moreover, if the individual is in a subordinate power position, and if he feels he had adequate opportunity to dissuade the group and that the group publicly confronted and tested all differences, then the individual will probably be motivated to work toward the group goal but still be motivated to generate new information that may change the group's decision. This means that one can be externally committed to a decision and internally committed to the decision-making processes that produced the decision yet simultaneously monitor the consequences of the decision thoroughly to seek new, valid information to reconfront the decision without being considered disloyal. In the model-II world, conflicts do not disappear&#8212;indeed, the illusion of conflict disappearing is more typical of the model-I world, in which conflicts are settled by power plays based on sanctions, charisma or loyalty. </p>	John Wiley & Sons, Inc.					2008-10-18T11:12:38-07:00		9	Jossey-Bass Publishers	San Francisco	103	chris_argyris_and_donald_schn	Chris_Argyris_and_Donald_Schön	Argyris, Chris and Schön, Donald	Chris <strong>Argyris</strong> and Donald <strong>Schön</strong>	<a href='../tags/decisions.html' rel='tag'>Decisions</a>, <a href='../tags/civ3m.html' rel='tag'>Civ3M</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Theory in Practice: Increasing Personal Effectiveness</cite>, <span class='city'>San Francisco</span>: <span class='publisher'>Jossey-Bass Publishers</span>, <span class='datepublished'>1974</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>103</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1555424465/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1555424465</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>1974</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</span>

This is the way of the Healer. </p> <p> 3. <i>Tell the truth without blame or judgment.</i> Nonjudgmental truthfulness maintains our authenticity, and develops our inner vision and intuition. This is the way of the Visionary. </p> <p> 4. <i>Be open to outcome, not attached to outcome.</i> Openness and nonattachment help us to recover the human resources of wisdom and objectivity.

Management	Robert D. Austin	Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations	3	Book	Copyright	1996	0932633366	Cockpits with Instruments Controlled by Gremlins	<p> One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments. </p> <p> Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic. Kaplan and Norton's cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps, fuel flow, and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature, but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments, for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements. It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations. </p>	Robert D.

Unity	Isaiah Berlin	The Hedgehog and the Fox	3	Book		1953	1566630193	The hedgehog and the fox	<p> There is a line among the fragments of the Greek poet Archilochus which says: &#8216;The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.&#8217; Scholars have differed about the correct interpretation of these dark words, which may mean no more than that the fox, for all his cunning, is defeated by the hedgehog's one defense. But, taken figuratively, the words can be made to yield a sense in which they mark one of the deepest differences which divide writers and thinkers, and, it may be, human beings in general. For there exists a great chasm between those, on one side, who relate everything to a single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel&#8212;a single, universal, organizing principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance&#8212;and, on the other side, those who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory. </p>						2008-02-29T10:17:09-08:00		18				isaiah_berlin	Isaiah_Berlin	Berlin, Isaiah	Isaiah <strong>Berlin</strong>	<a href='../tags/unity.html' rel='tag'>Unity</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>The Hedgehog and the Fox</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1953</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1566630193/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1566630193</a>

Dylan left the stage with a shrug as the crowd roared. Having heard only three songs, they wanted &#8216;moooooooooore&#8217;, and some, certainly, were booing. They had been taken by surprise by the volume and aggression of the music. Some loved it, some hated it, most were amazed, astonished and energized by it. It was something we take for granted now, but utterly novel then: non-linear lyrics, an attitude of total contempt for expectation and established values, accompanied by screaming blues guitar and a powerful rhythm section, played at ear-splitting volume by young kids. The Beatles were still singing love songs in 1965 while the Stones played a sexy brand of blues-rooted pop. This was different. This was the Birth of Rock. So many taste crimes have been committed in rock's name since then that it might be questionable to count this moment as a triumph, but it certainly felt like one in July 1965. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T09:16:34-08:00		29	Serpent's Tail	London	105	joe_boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/music-rock.html' rel='tag'>Music.Rock</a>, <a href='../tags/reason_to_rock.html' rel='tag'>Reason to Rock</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>105</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

We tried to pierce the veil of time and grasp what it sounded, felt, looked and smelled like. In Harvard Square and London I met many with similar preoccupations; they didn't seem unusual at all.

It was everything my twenty-one-year-old self might have dreamed of: 75,000 people packed into the Fairgrounds, with NPR-subscriber bags holding expertly marked programmes. America's black musical heritage was on parade across two long weekends and eight stages. But the audience was almost entirely white. The performers had learned their lessons, dropping any modernizations or slick showbiz gestures and recreating the old-time styles the sophisticated audiences craved. On one level, it demonstrated respect for a deep culture and a rejection of shallow novelty. But removed from the soil in which it grew the music felt lifeless, like actors portraying characters who happened to be their younger selves. In two days wandering from stage to stage, I heard little I recognized as music. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T09:33:08-08:00		31	Serpent's Tail	London	44	joe_boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/music-rock.html' rel='tag'>Music.Rock</a>, <a href='../tags/reason_to_rock.html' rel='tag'>Reason to Rock</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>44</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

Music.Rock, Reason to Rock	Joe Boyd	White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s	3	Book	Copyright	2006	1852429100	Records we made together in the sixties	<p> These days most engineers confronted with a displeasing sound reach for the knobs on the console and tweak the high, mid or low frequencies. When that process is inflicted on more and more tracks of a multi-channel recording the sound passes through dozens of transistors, resulting in a narrower, more confined sound. With the added limitations of digital sound, you end up with a bright and shiny, thin and two-dimensional recording. To my ears anyway. </p> <p> When John [Wood] heard a sound he didn't like, he would lift his bulky frame off the chair and lumber down the stairs, muttering all the way. I began to be able to predict whether he was going to try a different microphone, reposition the existing one or shift the offending musician to another part of the studio. When I listen to records we made together in the sixties, I can still hear the air in the studio and the full dimension of the sounds the musicians created for us. I can hear the depth of Nick Drake's breath as well as his voice, the grit in the crude strings of Robin Williamson's <cite>gimbri</cite> and Dave Mattacks&#8217; drum technique spread out warmly in aural Technicolor across the stereo spectrum. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T08:12:54-08:00		33	Serpent's Tail	London	204-205	joe_boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/music-rock.html' rel='tag'>Music.Rock</a>, <a href='../tags/reason_to_rock.html' rel='tag'>Reason to Rock</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, pages&nbsp;<span class='pages'>204-205</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

It was a time of unprecedented prosperity. People are supposedly wealthier now, yet most feel they haven't enough money and time is at an even greater premium.... In the sixties, we had surpluses of both money and time. </p> <p> Friends of mine lived comfortably in Greenwich Village, Harvard Square, Bayswater, Santa Monica and on the Left Bank and were, by current standards, broke. Yet they survived easily on occasional coffee-house gigs or part-time work. Today, urbanites must feverishly maximize their economic potential just to maintain a small flat in Hoboken, Somerville, Hackney, Korea Town or Belleville. The economy of the sixties cut us a lot of slack, leaving time to travel, take drugs, write songs and rethink the universe. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T07:28:14-08:00		34	Serpent's Tail	London	267	joe_boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/music-rock.html' rel='tag'>Music.Rock</a>, <a href='../tags/reason_to_rock.html' rel='tag'>Reason to Rock</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>267</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

It was one I knew well: a Stateside four-track EP licensed from the Excello label, with Slim Harpo on one side and Lazy Lester on the other. They played it until it was so worn they could barely hear the music through the scratches. One way of looking at the Stones&#8217; sound is as a South-East London adaptation of the Excello style.

Music.Rock, Reason to Rock	Joe Boyd	White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s	3	Book	Copyright	2006	1852429100	Tiny Dead Recording Spaces	<p> I have seen people enter pubs and bars where the <cite>Buena Vista Social Club</cite> CD is playing and look around for the source of the music; they seem startled to be entering a three-dimensional acoustic space. There were many recordings already on the market with similar Cuban singers and material when <cite>Buena Vista</cite> was released. Its success is usually ascribed to Cooder, the film or the brilliant marketing, all of which were certainly relevant. But I am convinced that the sound of the record was equally if not more important. Not only is it music from another era, magically preserved in the time capusule of Castro's communism, but was recorded using equally outdated techniques and painstakingly transferred to a digital master so that it retained as much of its analogue warmth as possible. The old Egrem studio in Havana is huge, an excellent but unforgiving room. Jerry [Boys], [Ry] Cooder and [Nick] Gold experimented a great deal with microphone placement. The recording captures the full sound of the three-dimensional space in which the musicians performed &#8212; live. If it had been made at one of the new digital studios in Havana, trying so hard to be &#8216;modern&#8217; with their tiny dead recording spaces and big control rooms, I doubt very much whether anyone beyond a few thousand Latin music enthusiasts would even know it existed. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T07:42:16-08:00		36	Serpent's Tail	London	209	joe_boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/music-rock.html' rel='tag'>Music.Rock</a>, <a href='../tags/reason_to_rock.html' rel='tag'>Reason to Rock</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>209</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

From the four tracks I began with, we went to eight, then sixteen, each increase doubling the tape's width. Just before I left for California came the beginning of the decline: some bright spark figured out how to squeeze twenty-four tracks on to the two-inch tape that previously held sixteen. The reduction in track width significantly degraded the sound quality.

Politics	G. K. Chesterton	Illustrated London News	3	unknown		1924		Conservatives and Progressives	<p> The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types &#8212; the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution. </p>						2011-04-22T06:06:37-07:00		230				g_k_chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

Mysticism	G. K.

He is not a mystic; and therefore he has a tendency to go mad. Men talk of the extravagances and frenzies that have been produced by mysticism; they are a mere drop in the bucket. In the main, and from the beginning of time, mysticism has kept men sane. The thing that has driven them mad was logic. ...The only thing that has kept the race of men from the mad extremes of the convent and the pirate-galley, the night-club and the lethal chamber, has been mysticism&#8212; the belief that logic is misleading, and that things are not what they seem. </p>						2011-04-22T06:04:28-07:00		228				g_k_chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G.

There is a certain poetic value, and that a genuine one, in this sense of having missed the full meaning of things. There is beauty, not only in wisdom, but in this dazed and dramatic ignorance. </p>						2011-04-22T06:03:10-07:00		227				g_k_chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

Progress	G. K. Chesterton	The Thing	3	Book		1929		Taking a Fence Down	<p> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it. </p>						2011-04-22T06:14:33-07:00		235				g_k_chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

If the world is good we are revolutionaries, if the world is evil we must be conservatives.

Spirituality	G. K. Chesterton	unknown	3	unknown				We are in Eden still	<p> There runs a strange law through the length of human history &#8212; that men are continually tending to undervalue their environment, to undervalue their happiness, to undervalue themselves. The great sin of mankind, the sin typified by the fall of Adam, is the tendency, not towards pride, but towards this weird and horrible humility. </p> <p> This is the great fall, the fall by which the fish forgets the sea, the ox forgets the meadow, the clerk forgets the city, every man forgets his environment and, in the fullest and most literal sense, forgets himself. This is the real fall of Adam, and it is a spiritual fall. It is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men, such as General Gordon, have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the Garden of Eden. Most probably we are in Eden still. It is only our eyes that have changed. </p>			Introduction			2011-04-22T06:12:38-07:00		234				g_k_chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

Religion	Albert Einstein	Religion and Science	3	Book		1930		Moral Religion	<p> The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, a development continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples&#8217; lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that all religions are a varying blend of both types, with this differentiation: that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates. </p>						2010-08-13T18:30:01-07:00		68				albert_einstein	Albert_Einstein	Einstein, Albert	Albert <strong>Einstein</strong>	<a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>Religion</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Religion and Science</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1930</span>

Religion	Albert Einstein	Religion and Science	3	Book		1930		This Highest Kind of Religious Feeling	<p> The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this. The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. </p>						2010-08-13T18:22:37-07:00		69				albert_einstein	Albert_Einstein	Einstein, Albert	Albert <strong>Einstein</strong>	<a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>Religion</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Religion and Science</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1930</span>

Design	Scott Jenson	The Simplicity Shift: Innovative Design Tactics in a Corporate World	3	Book	Copyright	2002	052152749X	User Interfaces Don't Exist	<p> In talking about Simplicity to others, I've found the standard definition of what a user interface is no longer works. We are trapped by the current definition. In fact, I've finally come to the conclusion that user interfaces don't exist. Or, at least, they don't exist in the same way we talk about them. The term <em>user interface</em> implies a single object, a bit of code, which represents everything the user can do with a product. This is misleading and dangerous, because it limits your thinking, analysis and planning about how to design a commercial product. </p> <p> We need a richer set of words to enable us greater explorations of problems and solutions. I suggest three separate layers ultimately compose the entire user experience: The Presentation layer, the Task layer, and the Infrastructure layer. </p>	Scott Jenson				http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/56/165	2008-10-12T13:26:27-07:00		102	Cambridge University Press	Cambridge, United Kingdom	27	scott_jenson	Scott_Jenson	Jenson, Scott	Scott <strong>Jenson</strong>	<a href='../tags/design.html' rel='tag'>Design</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>The Simplicity Shift: Innovative Design Tactics in a Corporate World</cite>, <span class='city'>Cambridge, United Kingdom</span>: <span class='publisher'>Cambridge University Press</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2002</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>27</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/052152749X/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>052152749X</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2002</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Scott Jenson</span>

But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem &#8212; and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works. That's what we wanted to do with Mac. </p>						2008-07-13T13:40:38-07:00		105				steve_jobs	Steve_Jobs	Jobs, Steve	Steve <strong>Jobs</strong>	<a href='../tags/simplicity.html' rel='tag'>Simplicity</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer that Changed Everything</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>2000</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140291776/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0140291776</a>

Thought	John F. Kennedy	Commencement Address at Yale University	3	Speech		1962		The Discomfort of Thought	<p> As every past generation has had to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of truisms and stereotypes, so in our own time we must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation with reality. </p> <p> For the great enemy of truth is very often not the lie &#8212; deliberate, contrived and dishonest &#8212; but the myth &#8212; persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. </p>		http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/003POF03Yale06111962.htm		http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/003POF03Yale06111962.htm		2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00		110				john_f_kennedy	John_F._Kennedy	Kennedy, John F.

Software Development	Steve Lohr	Go To	3	Book	Copyright	2001	0465042252	Software Much More Plastic Than Hardware	<p> The desire to treat software more like its hardware siblings began in earnest in the 1960s. Equal treatment was one motivation, at least at the start, but it was also an effort to make programming a more structured discipline like hardware engineering. Looking back, [David] Sayre observed that the Bald Peak conference had the regrettable effect of beginning a management mentality that served to &#8220;rigidify&#8221; programming at IBM. In the early days, he recalled that programming at IBM had an informal Silicon Valley flavor, which tended to encourage innovation. By the late 1960s, the working environment had become much more regimented. The disciplines of hardware engineering fit uneasily in the more ethereal realm of software. &#8220;Software is a much more plastic object than hardware,&#8221; Sayre said. &#8220;You whip it up, squeeze it, and you can dream.&#8221; </p>	Steve Lohr					2010-07-18T18:49:57-07:00		124	Basic Books	New York		steve_lohr	Steve_Lohr	Lohr, Steve	Steve <strong>Lohr</strong>	<a href='../tags/software_development.html' rel='tag'>Software Development</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Go To</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Basic Books</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2001</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465042252/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0465042252</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2001</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Steve Lohr</span>

On my 1040 form, that is what I put down as my occupation.&#8221; He has called programming an addiction of sorts, and it was in the Berkeley computer center that he got hooked. Sitting in the Bell Labs offices years later, he described the appeal as having all the craftsman's satisfactions of making things, without the cost and trouble of procuring the materials. &#8220;It's like building something where you don't have to order the cement,&#8221; Thompson said. &#8220;You create a world of your own, your own environment, and you never leave this room.&#8221; </p>	Steve Lohr					2010-07-18T19:02:55-07:00		125	Basic Books	New York		steve_lohr	Steve_Lohr	Lohr, Steve	Steve <strong>Lohr</strong>	<a href='../tags/software_development.html' rel='tag'>Software Development</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Go To</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Basic Books</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2001</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465042252/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0465042252</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2001</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Steve Lohr</span>

Even in a monstrous company laded with policy, process, and politics, you can't forget how to develop software. And how to develop software is changing. Now. Right under your feet, this very second. </p> <p> How in the world are you going to scale if you're slowly forgetting how software is made? </p> <p> I'm happy you're about to confuse your team by swimming in the developer pool. The simple fact is that well-defined roles in software development are fading. </p> <p> Everybody is talking to everybody else and they're learning from each other's mistakes ... and there's no reason that a manager shouldn't be participating in this massive global cross-pollination.... </p> <p> Besides, you want to be a part of a team of interchangeable parts. Not only does this make your team more nimble, it presents each person with the opportunity to see the product and the company from a vastly different perspective. </p>	Michael Lopp					2008-10-24T08:10:40-07:00		128	Apress		49-50	michael_lopp	Michael_Lopp	Lopp, Michael	Michael <strong>Lopp</strong>	<a href='../tags/management.html' rel='tag'>Management</a>, <a href='../tags/software_development.html' rel='tag'>Software Development</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager</cite>, <span class='publisher'>Apress</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2007</span>, pages&nbsp;<span class='pages'>49-50</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159059844X/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>159059844X</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2007</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Michael Lopp</span>

They were victims of rigorous forms of segregation that routinely and institutionally denied their humanity. So freedom was much more than a word to them. These pioneering musicians were exuberant about exhibiting this newfound personal freedom through their art. But they were also excited about hearing other people do the same thing. They understood that all were inextricably linked in freedom, just as they had been inextricably linked in bondage. And it wasn't theory; it was life as they lived it. </p>	Wynton Marsalis Enterprises					2008-10-20T13:28:13-07:00		131	Random House	New York	162	wynton_marsalis	Wynton_Marsalis	Marsalis, Wynton	Wynton <strong>Marsalis</strong>	<a href='../tags/art-jazz.html' rel='tag'>Art.Jazz</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Moving to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Random House</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>162</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400060788/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1400060788</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2008</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Wynton Marsalis Enterprises</span>

Because the musicians&#8217; skills and competence were so hard-earned, it was difficult to get them to compromise. Once jazzmen began making the decision to water down their artistry for notoriety, publicity, or money, our art began to face the same challenges that our government and many businesses face: dearth of leadership, lack of quality, loss of meaning, insensitivity to people&#8212;ultimately a wholesale loss of faith: &#8216;Well, what is jazz, anyway?&#8217; &#8216;What difference does it make what I play?&#8217; </p>	Wynton Marsalis Enterprises					2008-10-20T14:01:54-07:00		130	Random House	New York	166	wynton_marsalis	Wynton_Marsalis	Marsalis, Wynton	Wynton <strong>Marsalis</strong>	<a href='../tags/integrity.html' rel='tag'>Integrity</a>, <a href='../tags/music-jazz.html' rel='tag'>Music.Jazz</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Moving to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Random House</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>166</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400060788/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1400060788</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2008</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Wynton Marsalis Enterprises</span>

In jazz, the bass walks a note on every beat. The drummer rides the cymbal or plays brushes on every beat. And everybody else invents melodies and sounds that sway with, against, and upside every beat. Every beat requires musicians to reassess their relationships to one another. This is what makes swinging so challenging. You are forced to be constantly aware of other people's feelings. </p>	Wynton Marsalis Enterprises					2008-10-07T18:07:48-07:00		133	Random House	New York	40	wynton_marsalis	Wynton_Marsalis	Marsalis, Wynton	Wynton <strong>Marsalis</strong>	<a href='../tags/music-jazz.html' rel='tag'>Music.Jazz</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Moving to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Random House</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>40</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400060788/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1400060788</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2008</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Wynton Marsalis Enterprises</span>

It believes in our ability to make reasonable choices. It takes a chance on our decision-making skills instead of legislating our freedom away with written restrictions and restrictive hierarchies.

All the political and financial might in the world is diminished when put to the service of an impoverished cultural agenda.

Management	James M. Morgan and Jeffrey K. Liker	The Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process and Technology	3	Book		2006	1563272822	Role of Managers	<p> Unfortunately, many modern-day engineering managers believe their role in an organization is to attend meetings, keep abreast of the latest organizational policies, make the tough decisions about the big problems in the company, and generally look upward and outward. The philosophy seems to be that a good manager is good at delegating, and good engineers should work autonomously. </p> <p> In the United States, &#8216;nosing around&#8217; is being a busy body. It is a form of micromanagement. An effective manager should delegate and then stay out of the engineer's way. For a Toyota manager, this is abdicating responsibility. How can you consult and advise if you do not know what is going on? If you have no more information about what is going on across the organization than any other engineer, then what is your value? </p>						2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00		150	Productivity Press			james_m_morgan_and_jeffrey_k_liker	James_M._Morgan_and_Jeffrey_K._Liker	Morgan, James M. and Liker, Jeffrey K.

Liker	The Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process and Technology	3	Book		2006	1563272822	The Toyota Chief Engineer	<p> Most organizations use some form of the matrix system to determine who is reporting to whom and what respective roles and responsibilities will be. In most organizations, the matrix is a communications nightmare that spawns mixed allegiance and conflict between and among different parts of the organization. Toyota also uses a matrix, but the program boss is the chief engineer. The CE is ultimately the one person charged with the success of the design, development and sale of a car. The CE's ultimate responsibility is delivering value to the customer. While Toyota also emphasizes teamwork, there is always one person who is accountable for the success of the team.

While an overall architectural concept will be sketched out prior to coding, the validation of that architecture comes as the code is being written.

Thought	Bertrand Russell	Is There A God?	3	Essay		1952		The Celestial Teapot	<p> Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. </p>						2007-09-08T10:21:56-07:00		167				bertrand_russell	Bertrand_Russell	Russell, Bertrand	Bertrand <strong>Russell</strong>	<a href='../tags/thought.html' rel='tag'>Thought</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Essay</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Is There A God?</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1952</span>

Business	Matthew Stewart	The Management Myth: Why the Experts Keep Getting it Wrong	3	Book	Copyright	2009	0393065537	A Work Ethic Gone Mad	<p> The blend of corporate mysticism and transcendental consumerism he [Tom Peters] offers has its roots planted in the pragmatic, optimistic, can-do American work ethic. But, like the Taylorist philosophy from which it springs, it is also a work ethic gone mad. It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work. It becomes a deluded form of optimism, a feverish activity that masks an underlying anxiety about the meaning of life, a form of self-alienation so complete that the self disappears entirely into its consumer preferences and transactions. </p>	Matthew Stewart					2010-02-27T13:29:06-08:00		182	W.

Education, Business	Matthew Stewart	The Management Myth: Why the Experts Keep Getting it Wrong	3	Book	Copyright	2009	0393065537	Preparing Managers to Manage	<p> The time has come to recognize that higher education in management rests on a fatal fallacy. The idea behind the contemporary business school is that preparing future business managers means training them in a discipline called Business Management. After 100 years of fruitless attempts to produce such a discipline, it should be clear that it does not exist. Preparing managers to manage, in fact, is not different from preparing people to live in a civilized world. Managers do not need to be trained; they need to be <em>educated.</em> And for that purpose, although a certain amount of study of business-related subjects may prove useful, the business schools as they are presently constituted are at best superfluous. </p>	Matthew Stewart					2010-02-27T13:07:00-08:00		184	W.

Software Development	Gerald Weinberg	The Psychology of Computer Programming	3	Book	Copyright	1971	0932633420	Elimination of Programmers	<p> Over the years, executives have backed their desire to eliminate programmers with staggering funds.

Their touching faith in the magic of technology should serve as inspiration to those of us who daily bend our backs to the programmer's burden. Perhaps their wishes &#8212; though they can surely never be fulfilled &#8212; should give us pause &#8212; make us lift our noses from the coding pad or the terminal &#8212; and consider this human activity of ours from a human point of view. </p>	Litton Educational Publishing, Inc.					2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00		191				gerald_weinberg	Gerald_Weinberg	Weinberg, Gerald	Gerald <strong>Weinberg</strong>	<a href='../tags/software_development.html' rel='tag'>Software Development</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>The Psychology of Computer Programming</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1971</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932633420/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0932633420</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>1971</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Litton Educational Publishing, Inc.</span>

Spirituality	Ken Wilber	Beliefnet	3	Web Page				A Short and Simple List	<p> Let me start with a short and simple list. This is not the last word on the topic, but the first word, a simple list of suggestions to get the conversation going. Most of the great wisdom traditions agree that: </p> <p> 1. Spirit, by whatever name, exists. </p> <p> 2. Spirit, although existing out there, is found in here, or revealed within to the open heart and mind. </p> <p> 3. Most of us don't realize this Spirit within, however, because we are living in a world of sin, separation, or duality &#8212; that is, we are living in a fallen, illusory, or fragmented state. </p> <p> 4. There is a way out of this fallen state (of sin or illusion or disharmony), there is a Path to our liberation. </p> <p> 5. If we follow this Path to its conclusion, the result is a Rebirth or Enlightenment, a direct experience of Spirit within and without, a Supreme Liberation, which </p> <p> 6. marks the end of sin and suffering, and </p> <p> 7. manifests in social action of mercy and compassion on behalf of all sentient beings. </p> <p> Does a list something like that make sense to you? Because if there are these general spiritual patterns in the cosmos, at least wherever human beings appear, then this changes everything. You can be a practicing Christian and still agree with that list; you can be a practicing Neopagan and still agree with that list. </p>		http://www.beliefnet.com/story/141/story_14148_1.html	Why Do Religions Teach Love and Yet Cause So Much War?	http://www.beliefnet.com/story/141/story_14148_1.html		2007-02-10T15:26:31-08:00		198				ken_wilber	Ken_Wilber	Wilber, Ken	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	<a href='../tags/spirituality.html' rel='tag'>Spirituality</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Web Page</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Beliefnet</cite>, <cite class='minortitle'>&#8220;Why Do Religions Teach Love and Yet Cause So Much War?&#8221;</cite>

God	Ken Wilber	Beliefnet	3	Web Page				An Integral God	<p> An archaic God sees divinity in any strong instinctual force. A magic God locates divine power in the human ego and its magical capacity to change the animistic world with rituals and spells. A mythic God is located not on this earth but in a heavenly paradise not of this world, entrance to which is gained by living according to the covenants and rules given by this God to his peoples. A mental God is a rational God, a demythologized Ground of Being that underlies all forms of existence. And an integral God is one that embraces all of the above. </p>		http://www.beliefnet.com/story/141/story_14148_1.html	Why Do Religions Teach Love and Yet Cause So Much War?	http://www.beliefnet.com/story/141/story_14148_1.html		2007-02-11T09:48:55-08:00		199				ken_wilber	Ken_Wilber	Wilber, Ken	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	<a href='../tags/god.html' rel='tag'>God</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Web Page</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Beliefnet</cite>, <cite class='minortitle'>&#8220;Why Do Religions Teach Love and Yet Cause So Much War?&#8221;</cite>

Diversity	Ken Wilber	Beliefnet	3	Web Page				Homophobia	<p> An integral approach acknowledges that all views have a degree of truth, but some views are more true than others, more evolved, more developed, more adequate. And so let's get that part out of the way right now: homophobia in any form, as far as I can tell, stems from a lower level of human development — but it is a level, it exists, and one has to make room in one's awareness for those lower levels as well, just as one has to include third grade in any school curriculum.

Integral Approach	Ken Wilber	the integral vision	3	Book	Copyright	2007	1590304756	Levels of Development	<p> To grasp what is involved with levels or stages, let's use a very simple model possessing only 3 of them. If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture's ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant's awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture's rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child's particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual's identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p> <p> Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric)&#8212;a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>	Ken Wilber					2008-10-19T09:28:50-07:00		197	Shambhala	Boston & London	34	ken_wilber	Ken_Wilber	Wilber, Ken	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	<a href='../tags/integral_approach.html' rel='tag'>Integral Approach</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>the integral vision</cite>, <span class='city'>Boston &amp; London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Shambhala</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2007</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>34</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590304756/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1590304756</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2007</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Ken Wilber</span>
Truth	Ken Wilber	Beliefnet	3	Web Page				The Beautiful, the Good and the True	<p> If you are talking to me about your new car, you are the first person, I am the second person, and the car is the third person. These pronouns actually represent three perspectives that human beings can take when they talk about the world or attempt to know the world.... The fascinating part is that these three perspectives might actually give rise to art, morals, and science. Or the Beautiful, the Good, and the True: the Beauty that is in the eye (or the I) of the beholder; the Good or moral actions that can exist between you and me as a we; and the objective Truth about third-person objects (or its) that you and I might discover: hence, art (I), morals (we), and science (it). </p>		http://www.beliefnet.com/story/141/story_14148_1.html	Why Do Religions Teach Love and Yet Cause So Much War?	http://www.beliefnet.com/story/141/story_14148_1.html		2007-02-11T09:42:57-08:00		201				ken_wilber	Ken_Wilber	Wilber, Ken	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	<a href='../tags/truth.html' rel='tag'>Truth</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Web Page</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Beliefnet</cite>, <cite class='minortitle'>&#8220;Why Do Religions Teach Love and Yet Cause So Much War?&#8221;</cite>	
Population Explosion	E. O. Wilson	Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge	3	Book		1998	0679450777	A Planet-Sized Problem	<p> Few will doubt that humankind has created a planet-sized problem for itself. No one wished it so, but we are the first species to become a geophysical force, altering Earth's climate, a role previously reserved for tectonics, sun flares, and glacial cycles. We are also the greatest destroyer of life since the ten-kilometer-wide meteorite that landed near Yucatan and ended the Age of Reptiles sixty-five million years ago. Through overpopulation we have put ourselves in danger of running out of food and water. So a very Faustian choice is upon us: whether to accept our corrosive and risky behavior as the unavoidable price of population and economic growth, or to take stock of ourselves and search for a new environmental ethic. </p>						2010-10-26T20:07:27-07:00		214	Alfred A.

Virtue	E. O. Wilson	Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge	3	Book		1998	0679450777	True Character	<p> True character arises from a deeper well than religion. It is the internalization of moral principles of a society, augmented by those tenets personally chosen by the individual, strong enough to endure through trials of solitude and adversity. The principles are fitted together into what we call integrity, literally the integrated self, wherein personal decisions feel good and true. Character is in turn the enduring source of virtue. It stands by itself and excites admiration in others. It is not obedience to authority, and while it is often consistent with and reinforced by religious belief, it is not piety. </p>						2010-10-26T20:00:28-07:00		212	Alfred A.
