The iWisdom program is distributed in two different forms. 

The first form is as a zip archive. This form can be used on either a Windows machine or on Mac OS X (or any other Unix platform). Once downloaded and expanded, you will see a folder containg multiple files and sub-folders. To install iWisdom, drag the entire iWisdom Folder into the location on your hard drive where you normally keep your applications: usually the Applications folder on a Mac, and the My Programs folder on a Windows PC. Launch iWisdom by double-clicking on the file named iwisdom.jar. 

The second form of distribution is as a Mac OS X disk image. This form can only be used on Mac OS X (and is the recommended distribution package for the Mac). Once downloaded and mounted (via a double-click if it doesn't mount automatically), you will see a folder containing a complete self-contained application bundle, plus this file. To install iWisdom, drag the iWisdom app into your Applications folder. Launch iWisdom by double-clicking on the app file.  

Note that iWisdom is written in Java, and that your computer must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) of 1.5 or better.
