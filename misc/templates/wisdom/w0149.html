          <blockquote>
            <p> With smaller teams doing more for less, removing yourself from the code strikes me as a bad career move. Even in a monstrous company laded with policy, process, and politics, you can't forget how to develop software. And how to develop software is changing. Now. Right under your feet, this very second. </p> <p> How in the world are you going to scale if you're slowly forgetting how software is made? </p> <p> I'm happy you're about to confuse your team by swimming in the developer pool. The simple fact is that well-defined roles in software development are fading. </p> <p> Everybody is talking to everybody else and they're learning from each other's mistakes ... and there's no reason that a manager shouldn't be participating in thes massive global cross-pollination .... </p> <p> Besides, you want to be a part of a team of interchangeable parts. Not only does this make your team more nimble, it presents each person with the opportunity to see the product and the company from a vastly different perspective. </p>
