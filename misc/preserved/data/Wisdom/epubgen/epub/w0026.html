      <h2>A Sailor's Life</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p> ...a traditional ballad Sandy [Denny] had taught them [Fairport Convention] called &#8216;A Sailor's Life&#8217;...turned English folk music on its head. The implications of their version of this old ballad have reverberated far and wide. A member of Los Lobos told a friend of mine that they had been just another rock band from East LA until &#8216;A Sailor's Life&#8217; challenged them to find in their own Mexican traditions something as rich as Fairport had found in their English ones. </p>
