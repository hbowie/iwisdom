Bug Fix	Bug Fix					10/21/2006	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	3	9		1.01	Corrected JVM Dependencies		Version 1.00 could only be run on Java 1.5. For Mac users, this meant it could only be run on Mac OS X 10.4.

Removed several windows from the string of tabs that existed before and put them in more logical locations, with the locations in some cases being dependent on the OS on which the application is run. The changes are described going from right to left along the old string of tabs. <br><br>The About tab is now available on the Mac at the iWisdom menu / About item, and on Windows at the Help menu / About iWisdom item.<br><br>The Log tab is now available from the Window menu / Log item, on all operating systems. <br><br>The Prefs and View tabs are now available from a tabbed Preferences window, which is available on the Mac at the iWisdom menu / Preferences item, and on Windows at the Tools menu / Options item. <br><br>The Export and Import tabs are now available as separate windows from their respective items under the File menu, on all operating systems. <br><br>The four remaining tabs are now split between two different panes. The List and Category tabs are on the left/top pane, and the Display and Edit tabs are on the right/bottom pane (a new check box under General Preferences allow you to choose you to split the panes horizontally or vertically). The first two panes act as selection panes, and the last two allow you to view/edit a single, selected item.  <br><br>What used to be known as the Rotate button is now called the Scan button, and has been moved to the tool bar. Clicking once begins the process of showing a different item in the Display window every few seconds, and clicking again on the same button now ends the scan. <br><br>Additionally, a search field has now been added to the toolbar, followed by a Find Button. <br>		N/A	0	-1	-1	2007-08-13	Action	0	 	 	<a href='tags/redesign.html' rel='tag'>Redesign</a>

On a Mac, you may import a file simply by dragging and dropping the file onto the application. The ability to parse the text files and accurately identify authors, quotations, years and categories has been improved, although the extent to which this will work well for any individual text file is hard to predict, due to the variation in formatting used within these sorts of files.

When publishing a collection to a Web site, a shortcut file is generated for each item in the collection, with each shortcut file redirecting to the actual HTML file at the longer URL location. The shortcut file is designed to provide a shorter URL that can be used to reference a Wisdom item.

Bug Fix	Bug Fix					06/03/2008	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	3	9		1.70	Corrected Item/Duplicate Problem		Corrected bug in Item/Duplicate processing. Starting with version 1.60, when a new item is added, its text is compared to that of existing entries and, if a duplicate is found, the new entry is merged with the old one, rather than being added. Unfortunately, when an item was requested to be duplicated, the second occurrence of the item was being merged with the first, resulting in no change. This was corrected by changing the body of the new item to some standard text referring to the duplication. This allows the user to duplicate an entry in order to avoid rekeying author and source information for multiple entries from the same source.

Item Scope allows the user to select only the currently selected entry, all items in a selected category, or the entire collection. The available Formats depends on the chosen Field Scope, but now includes Markdown and Textile formats when Wisdom List is selected. Finally, the destination for any of these choices may now be either an output file, or the System Clipboard (allowing the results to be subsequently pasted into another program).

New Feature	New Feature					06/30/2011	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	3	9		2.30	Multiple Wisdom Storage Options		The user now has multiple options for the organization and format of his or her wisdom collection. These are all visible from the Info Window, accessible from the File / Get Info menu. The first option is format. The first possible choice here is &quot;XML&quot;, which is the default, and has historically been the only possibility. The second, and new, possible choice is &quot;Text - Structured&quot;. Selecting this choice will result in files with the &quot;.txt&quot; extension, using a subset of YAML as a storage format. The next option is whether to organize your wisdom items in a series of folders, named for authors and their works, or simply in a single top-level folder. The third option is whether to name your files using the titles of the items, or simply by sequential numbers. <br><br>In particular, if you choose the Structured Text format, without folders, and with files named by Item Number, you will end up with a folder of files that can be pretty easily synced to &quot;the Cloud&quot; and/or to other devices, and then created/modified edited using any text editor. <br>		N/A	0	-1	-1	2011-06-30	Action	0	 	 	<a href='tags/new-feature.html' rel='tag'>New Feature</a>
