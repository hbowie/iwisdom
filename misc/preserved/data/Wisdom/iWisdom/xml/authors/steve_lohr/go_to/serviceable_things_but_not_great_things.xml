        The difference, [Fred] Brooks said, was that the languages and operating systems with fanatical fan clubs were "originally designed to satisfy a designer or a very small group of designers." Whereas the successful products unable to inspire fan clubs, he noted, were "designed to satisfy a large set of requirements" -- they were "done inside of product processes." So, Brooks asked, "What does that tell us about product processes?" His answer: "They produce serviceable things, but not great things."
