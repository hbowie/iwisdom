      <h2>Elimination of Programmers</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Over the years, executives have backed their desire to eliminate programmers with staggering funds. Dozens of simplistic schemes have been heaped with money and praise on the promise &#8212; as yet not kept &#8212; of going directly from a sales proposal to a working data-processing system. Their touching faith in the magic of technology should serve as inspiration to those of us who daily bend our backs to the programmer's burden. Perhaps their wishes &#8212; though they can surely never be fulfilled &#8212; should give us pause &#8212; make us lift our noses from the coding pad or the terminal &#8212; and consider this human activity of ours from a human point of view. </p>
