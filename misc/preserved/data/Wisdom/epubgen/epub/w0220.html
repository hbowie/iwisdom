      <h2>It is Us, and It is What We're About</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Mitch Murray was writing songs. He came up with &#8220;How do you do it? How do you do what you do to me?&#8221; We listened to the demo and said, &#8220;It's a hit, George, but we’ve got a song, &#8216;Love Me Do.&#8217;&#8221; George said, &#8220;I don’t think yours is such a big hit.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes, but it is us, and it is what we’re about.&#8221; </p> <p> ...but they were adamant, thank God, about not wanting this song they'd been given. On reflection, this was a huge stance because, as I say, for that bit of plastic you would sell your soul. </p>
