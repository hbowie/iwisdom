      <h2>Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p> &#8220;I can't believe that!&#8221; said Alice. </p> <p> &#8220;Can't you?&#8221; the Queen said in a pitying tone. &#8220;Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.&#8221; </p> <p> Alice laughed. &#8220;There's no use trying,&#8221; she said &#8220;one can't believe impossible things.&#8221; </p> <p> &#8220;I daresay you haven't had much practice,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.&#8221; </p>
