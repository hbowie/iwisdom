      <p>
        Over the years, executives have backed their desire to eliminate programmers with staggering funds. Dozens of simplistic schemes have been heaped with money and praise on the promise -- as yet not kept -- of going directly from a sales proposal to a working data-processing system. Their touching faith in the magic of technology should serve as inspiration to those of us who daily bend our backs to the programmer's burden. Perhaps their wishes -- though they can surely never be fulfilled -- should give us pause -- make us lift our noses from the coding pad or the terminal -- and consider this human activity of ours from a human point of view.
