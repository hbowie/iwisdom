      <h2>Her Life Was Saved by Rock and Roll</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Jenny said when she was just about five years old, <br /> You know, “My parents are going to be the death of us all.” </p> <p> “Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars, well you know, <br /> It ain't going to help me at all (not just a tiny bit).” </p> <p> Then one fine morning she turns on a New York station, <br /> She doesn't believe what she hears at all. </p> <p> She started dancing to that fine, fine music, <br /> You know her life was saved by rock and roll. </p>
