      <h2>Serviceable Things, But Not Great Things</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p> The difference, [Fred] Brooks said, was that the languages and operating systems with fanatical fan clubs were &#8220;originally designed to satisfy a designer or a very small group of designers.&#8221; Whereas the successful products unable to inspire fan clubs, he noted, were &#8220;designed to satisfy a large set of requirements&#8221; &#8212; they were &#8220;done inside of product processes.&#8221; So, Brooks asked, &#8220;What does that tell us about product processes?&#8221; His answer: &#8220;They produce serviceable things, but not great things.&#8221; </p>
